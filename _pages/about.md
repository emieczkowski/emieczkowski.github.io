I am a second-year PhD student advised by <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Tom Griffiths</a> and <a href="https://nataliavelez.org/" target="_blank">Natalia VÃ©lez</a> in the <a href="https://aiml.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">AI & ML area</a> of the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at Princeton University. I am supported by the Department of Defense National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) and the Gordon Y. S. Wu Fellowship in Engineering.

I study the optimal strategies underlying multi-agent collaboration by combining insights from cognitive science, large-scale multiplayer experiments, distributed computer systems, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. My research currently addresses two main questions: How can theories from distributed systems help us better understand the complex challenges and solutions that arise when dividing labor and resources during collaborative tasks? And how can these insights be used to improve the way that AI agents collaborate with people? 

Before starting my PhD, I spent two years as a lab tech with <a href="https://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/index.shtml" target="_blank">Nancy Kanwisher</a> at MIT, where I studied similarities and divergences between CNNs and visual representations in the human brain. I received my B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology from <a href="https://as.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a> in 2021, where I conducted research in autonomous navigation and natural language processing. In 2019 and 2020, I was a software engineering intern at The New York Times.
