I am a first-year PhD student advised by <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Tom Griffiths</a> and <a href="https://nataliavelez.org/" target="_blank">Natalia VÃ©lez</a> in the <a href="https://aiml.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">AI & ML area</a> of the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at Princeton University. I am supported by the Department of Defense National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) and the Gordon Y. S. Wu Fellowship in Engineering.

I study the optimal strategies underlying multi-agent collaboration using theories from distributed computer systems. This distributed systems approach is useful for formalizing collaborative strategies because it focuses on (a) the potential challenges and solutions that systems face when transitioning from individual to group-level processing, and (b) how systems can improve and benchmark efficiency as tasks are allocated and scaled across processors. Currently, I am interested in division of labor and how it can be related to parallel versus serial processing. When and how do groups of people parallelize tasks to effectively minimize time and energy usage? How do we maintain global task coherence when dividing subtasks amongst groups?

Before starting my PhD, I spent two years as a lab tech with <a href="https://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/index.shtml" target="_blank">Nancy Kanwisher</a> at MIT, where I studied similarities and divergences between CNNs and visual representations in the human brain. I received my B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology from <a href="https://as.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a> in 2021, where I conducted research in autonomous navigation and natural language processing. In 2019 and 2020, I was a software engineering intern at The New York Times.
