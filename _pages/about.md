I am a first-year PhD student advised by <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Tom Griffiths</a> and <a href="https://nataliavelez.org/" target="_blank">Natalia VÃ©lez</a> in the <a href="https://aiml.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">AI & ML area</a> of the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at Princeton University. I am supported by the Gordon Y. S. Wu Fellowship in Engineering.

I study how humans work together to solve tasks using a combination of computational models and behavioral data. Currently, I am interested in questions related to parallel vs. serial processing and division of labor. When and how should individuals parallelize tasks to effectively minimize time and energy usage? How do we maintain global task coherence and consistency when dividing subtasks amongst groups? 

Before starting my PhD, I spent two years as a lab tech with <a href="https://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/index.shtml" target="_blank">Nancy Kanwisher</a> at MIT, where I studied similarities and divergences between CNNs and visual representations in the human brain. I received my B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology from <a href="https://as.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a> in 2021, where I conducted research in autonomous navigation and natural language processing. In 2019 and 2020, I was a software engineering intern at The New York Times.
